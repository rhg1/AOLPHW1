This guy is funny. I'm not sure I completely agree with the whole "there is no
engineering in building software", but I get his point. I picked compsci because
I did think it is a very creative field. I feel that most people that get into
it understand this. Although, managing outside perspectives is difficult.
Interesting that he thinks that building a programming language is fun work. I
think the way he describes why compsci isn't science because you learn by doing
is very clever, and true. Overall, incredible lecture.
